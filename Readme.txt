The assets used:
Playign card pictures: https://opengameart.org/content/playing-cards-vector-png

What is done so far:

-I uploaded the card images into the project and made the code extract a random image for the cards.
-You can only move the cards to stack on top of other cards.
-If you release mouse in an invalid position the card will return to the original position.

Problems:

- You are able to grab the card on the bottom of the stack from the part that is sticking out
- The cards aren't random it is the same seed (know how to fix it from class)
- no deck visible and stack placed for the aces and the deck
